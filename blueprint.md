# Food Donation Platform

## Overview

This application is a platform that connects food donors with NGOs. Donors can create listings for food they want to donate, and NGOs can browse and accept these donations. The platform is built using React and Firebase.

## Features

*   User authentication (sign up and sign in for donors and NGOs).
*   Donors can create food donation listings, specifying the type of food, quantity, expiration date, and pickup location.
*   NGOs can view a list of available food donations.
*   NGOs can accept donations, which removes them from the list of available donations.
*   Donors have a dashboard to view the status of their donations.
*   NGOs have a dashboard to view the donations they have accepted.

## Styling and Design

*   The application uses the Material-UI component library for a clean and modern look.
*   The layout is organized using a grid system to separate different sections of the application.
*   The dashboards for donors and NGOs are designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
*   Donation lists are styled with borders and padding to improve readability.

## Current Plan

I have completed the development of the food donation platform. I have implemented the core functionalities for donors to create donations and for NGOs to accept them. I have also created dashboards for both user types to track their donations. Finally, I have applied some styling to improve the user experience and make the application more visually appealing.
